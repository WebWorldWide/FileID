## 2026-05-22 — V16.20 push V16.16–V16.19 + clear two pre-existing CI reds

Committed and pushed the session's work (CLIP split, crash fix, Deep Analyze gating, preview
nav/video, Restructure auto-gen, Cleanup thumbnails, docs trim) to `origin/main`. Two pipelines
were already red before this push and are fixed here:
- **Engine** `Privacy — source URL allowlist scan` (x64) had failed since `models/vlm_server.rs`
  landed — it formats `http://127.0.0.1:{port}` for the local llama-server and `127.0.0.1` wasn't
  allowlisted. Fixed by exempting loopback hosts in the scan (loopback is never egress; see
  DECISIONS V16.20). arm64 was always green (the scan is x64-only).
- **App** `Format check` (x64) had failed on `Add braces to 'if' statement` (IDE0011); the brace
  fix was already in this session's tree, so `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` is clean now.

### Build/test (local, pre-push)
- Engine: `cargo +1.90 fmt --check` + `clippy --all-targets -D warnings` + `test --all-targets`
  all green; URL-allowlist scan replicated locally → PASS.
- App: `dotnet build -c Release -p:Platform=x64` → 0 errors; `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` clean.

## 2026-05-21 — V16.19 macOS parity: Restructure auto-generates + Cleanup thumbnails

- **Restructure auto-generates** (macOS RestructureView.swift `.task`/`.onChange`): no manual
  "Generate plan" click. `RestructureView.OnLoaded` renders an already-computed plan (cached on
  the engine across tab switches) or, if none, auto-runs `PlanRestructureAsync` when a library
  folder is scanned; it also re-generates on `DeepAnalyzeComplete` so the People/<name> buckets
  reflect newly-named clusters. The Generate button stays as a manual re-gen.
- **Cleanup shows thumbnails** (macOS CopyTile parity): each duplicate group is now a
  horizontal strip of 132-px thumbnail tiles (thumbnail + filename + size + Keep radio) instead
  of text rows. Tiles load lazily through `ThumbnailService` via the members ItemsRepeater's
  `ElementPrepared`/`ElementClearing` (cancel + release on recycle) — the same
  virtualization-friendly pattern LibraryView uses. `DuplicateMember` gained `Thumbnail` +
  `ShowPlaceholder` + recycle guards.

### Build/test
- C# `dotnet build` 0/0, `dotnet format` clean, BOM intact.
- **User on hardware:** open Restructure with a scanned folder → a plan appears without
  clicking Generate; open Cleanup → each duplicate group shows file thumbnails.

## 2026-05-21 — V16.18 preview: arrow-key navigation + video player hardening

User-reported: arrow keys didn't move between items in the preview, and the video player was
buggy. `FilePreviewSheet`:
- **Arrow-key nav fixed.** The ←/→/Esc handler existed but only fired with keyboard focus
  inside the sheet — and the host ContentDialog (no default button) left focus on the dialog
  chrome, so keys never reached it. The sheet now grabs focus on `Loaded` and uses tunneling
  `PreviewKeyDown`, so ←/→ navigate siblings from anywhere in the sheet (overriding a focused
  video's seek), while the tag `TextBox` keeps ←/→ for its cursor. Esc closes.
- **Video player hardened.** Switched to `MediaSource.CreateFromStorageFile` (the StorageFile
  broker — same path the thumbnail loader uses) instead of a raw `file://` URI, which is more
  reliable for arbitrary local paths. The `MediaSource` is now disposed on navigation and the
  `MediaPlayer` is disposed on close — pause+null alone left audio playing and the file handle
  pinned. A generation guard drops stale async loads when arrow-navigating quickly through clips.

### Build/test
- C# `dotnet build` 0/0, `dotnet format` clean, BOM intact (UI behavior is the user's check).
- **User on hardware:** open a preview → ←/→ move between files (incl. over a video); play a
  video then close → audio stops + the file isn't locked; arrow through several clips → no glitch.

## 2026-05-21 — V16.17 CLIP scene-tagging OFF; CLIP kept for semantic search

SmolVLM is the sole tagger; CLIP must not emit tags — but free-text semantic search is kept
(user asked to keep it). CLIP (MobileCLIP-S2) did two independent jobs sharing the per-file
image embedding: scan-time scene tags (`source='auto'`) and the Library's semantic-search
embedding. Scene tags are now off; the search embedding stays. (SmolVLM is a generative VLM,
not a dual-encoder, so it can't do embedding search itself — CLIP runs alongside it for that.)

- **Engine.** `ENABLE_CLIP_SCENE_TAGS = false` → the `tagging.rs:954` scene-scoring block is
  skipped, so no `source='auto'` tags. `ENABLE_CLIP = true` keeps the MobileCLIP image encoder
  loading + the per-file embedding (stored in `clip_embeddings`) for semantic search.
  `load_default` builds the scene labeler ONLY when BOTH flags are on, so the ~21 s
  scene-matrix build is skipped (it's tags-only). SmolVLM (`source='vlm'`) is the sole tagger;
  `ReadStore` already orders vlm ahead of auto. The `commands/embed.rs` `!ENABLE_CLIP`
  short-circuit + the C# empty→null guards stay as harmless defense.
- **App.** Library semantic search works as before (MobileCLIP query embedding → cosine over
  `clip_embeddings`); the "install CLIP for search" banner, the MobileCLIP install card
  (Settings + Welcome), and CLIP in onboarding (`InstallAll`/`AllInstalled`) all stay. Settings
  diagnostic now reads "Tags: SmolVLM; Semantic search: MobileCLIP-S2."
- **Net:** no CLIP tags (SmolVLM only), semantic search preserved. To drop CLIP entirely
  (search → FTS5), flip `ENABLE_CLIP = false`.

### Build/test
- Engine on the pinned **1.90** toolchain: `clippy --all-targets -D warnings` clean, `test
  --lib` 158/0, `fmt --check` clean. C# `dotnet build` 0/0, `dotnet format` clean, UTF-8 BOM
  intact (incl. a BOM added to `WelcomeSheet.xaml` per `.editorconfig`).
- **User on hardware:** re-scan → tags are SmolVLM-only (`SELECT DISTINCT source FROM tags`
  has no `auto`); free-text search ("a dog at the beach") still returns semantic matches;
  `clip_embeddings` populates on new files; engine log shows no ~21 s scene-matrix build.

## 2026-05-21 — V16.16 mid-scan crash root-caused + fixed; Deep Analyze gating honest

The "click a page mid-scan → crash" bug was misattributed (the V16.5c DetailHostView
async-race theory). Three crash dumps from today (pid 19792, 12:03:21/23/32) were
identical: `NullReferenceException at RestructureView.OnVisualizationModeChanged` — a
`<ComboBox SelectedIndex="0" SelectionChanged=…>` raising SelectionChanged during
`InitializeComponent()`, before the `Sankey`/`TreeDiff` fields exist. It fired every time
the Restructure tab opened; `App.OnUnhandledException` (e.Handled=true) softened it to a
half-built tab, not a hard kill.

- **Crash fixed.** `RestructureView.OnVisualizationModeChanged` null-guards its siblings +
  wraps in `DebugLog.SafeRun`. Audited the init-fire pattern repo-wide — only this site crashed.
- **Settings EP-override clobber fixed (same pattern).** `SettingsView.OnProviderOverrideChanged`
  fired during `InitializeComponent` (before `HydrateToggles`/`_initializingToggles`),
  resetting the GPU EP override to "auto" on every Settings open. Now `!IsLoaded`-guarded.
- **ViewModel teardown race hardened.** People/Cleanup/Library `RefreshAsync` now create the
  linked `CancellationTokenSource` INSIDE the try, so a `Dispose()`-race
  `ObjectDisposedException` (from `_disposalCts.Token`) is caught as a clean no-op instead of
  escaping to the caller — that was the empty-message "OnLoaded refresh threw" log noise.
- **Deep Analyze gating honest** (`commands/deep_analyze.rs`): weights-gate FIRST →
  `vlm_model_missing` ("install it from the Deep Analyze tab") instead of a misleading
  runtime error / N silent per-file failures; one `llama_cpp_missing` when no backend can
  run the present weights. The engine source was already correct (registry pinned **b9254**,
  persistent llama-server is the default backend); the user's `llama_cpp_missing` is a STALE
  on-disk runtime (b4475, no llama-mtmd-cli.exe) + uninstalled Qwen weights — a rebuild +
  reinstall, not a code bug.
- **Audits + hygiene.** Dead code: all 32 engine `#[allow(dead_code)]` sites are deliberate
  (functional structs, a documented test fixture, non-Windows cfg-stubs, a parity primitive,
  future hooks) — nothing safe to remove; clippy confirms no *unmarked* dead code. Standards:
  `cargo fmt`/`clippy -D warnings`/`dotnet format`/analyzers all clean, BOM intact. Comments:
  conservative condensation of the verbose history blocks in the high-traffic views/services
  (ThumbnailService, sidebar controls, DeepAnalyzeView) — the load-bearing invariant/forensics
  comments CLAUDE.md flags are kept deliberately.
- **Docs.** STATE/NEXT/DECISIONS trimmed to a lean baseline; PACKS.md + DB-RESEARCH.md
  retired (refs fixed); PHASES checkbox/label + stale Phase-N notes corrected.

### Build/test
- C# `dotnet build FileID.sln -c Debug -p:Platform=x64` green (0/0) + `dotnet format` clean.
  Engine `cargo check`/`clippy --all-targets -D warnings`/`test --lib` (158/0)/`fmt --check`
  all green. (These gates run headlessly in the agent env now — see auto-memory.)
- **User, on hardware:** rebuild engine → relaunch (auto-reinstalls the b9254 runtime) →
  install Qwen2.5-VL-3B → open Restructure mid-scan (no crash) → scan → SmolVLM tags + Deep
  Analyze captions. Per NEXT.md V16.16.

## 2026-05-21 — V16.15 face crops fixed + 1-2 word tags + download jitter + dead code

- **Faces (root-caused + fixed).** SCRFD emits bbox as `[x1,y1,x2,y2]` corners
  (`scrfd.rs`, rescaled to original-image px by `detect()`), but `tagging.rs` fed it to
  `crop_and_resize_face` + stored it as `[x,y,w,h]` — so the crop ran from the face's
  top-left to the image's bottom-right ("not a face"/blank), and that smear was also fed
  to ArcFace (corrupting clustering). Now converted corners→xywh once at the
  detect→`DetectedFace` site → real face crops, meaningful embeddings, correct persisted
  bbox. (`validate_face_geometry` was already correct.) Follow-up: landmark-aligned
  ArcFace chips for better cluster accuracy.
- **Tags are 1-2 words.** `parse_vlm_tags` drops 3+-word fragments (was >3); the SmolVLM
  TAG_PROMPT already asks for 1-2 words.
- **Deep Analyze model reality (verified).** Qwen3-VL-4B has **no GGUF** (ggml-org has
  only Qwen3-VL 2B/30B; macOS uses MLX), and Qwen2.5-VL-7B (~4.7 GB) OOMs on the 4 GB
  card at `-ngl 99`. So Deep Analyze stays **Qwen2.5-VL-3B** (strongest Qwen that fits +
  already a card + full descriptive captions). Gemma-3-4B card swap + 7B-with-VRAM-aware
  `-ngl` flagged as follow-ups (need blind-unverifiable C# x:Name work / an engine change).
  See DECISIONS.
- **Download "freaking out" fixed.** `ModelSlot.UpdateRate` no longer zeroes rate/ETA at
  every per-file fraction reset in a multi-file bundle (carries the prior rate) — that was
  the 0-blip / "Stalled" flicker; sample interval 500→250 ms. `downloader.rs` progress
  throttle 100→50 ms + progress channel 256→512. (Already 12-way parallel range-GET; true
  throughput is near-capped.)
- **Dead code.** Removed the unused `run_ocr_blocking_arc` (live path is
  `run_ocr_blocking`). Remaining engine `#[allow(dead_code)]` are deliberate (test helper
  `ModelStack::empty`, non-Windows cfg-stubs, the pool-path CLIP `embed`). A broad
  slop-comment purge is **deferred** — much of the codebase's verbosity is the
  load-bearing institutional memory the CLAUDE.md says not to strip; touched code is
  WHY-focused.

### Build/test
- Engine `cargo clippy --all-targets -D warnings` clean + `cargo test --lib` **158/0**
  (toolchain 1.90). C# (`ModelSlot`) `dotnet format` clean + BOM intact. WinUI compile is
  the user's VS build. Verify faces/tags/downloads on hardware per NEXT.md V16.15.

## 2026-05-21 — V16.14 small-screen / anti-clipping UI pass

User reported laptop UI content getting cut off. XAML audit (read-only — can't render
here) + conservative responsive fixes to the clear overflow patterns:
- **Deep Analyze action row** (7 controls: Whole library / Selected / Current / Skip
  toggle / Propose renames / Cancel) wrapped in a horizontal ScrollViewer (the
  PeopleView/CleanupView header pattern), so its right-hand controls can't clip on a
  narrow window — the most likely "cut off" culprit.
- **Oversized modal sheets shrunk to fit a laptop** (each already has an inner
  ScrollViewer for overflow): `FilePreviewSheet` 1080×720 → **880×520** (the worst —
  720-tall didn't fit a 768-px screen once title bar + taskbar are subtracted);
  `PersonDetailSheet` 480→440 H; `SuggestedMergesSheet` 520→440 H; `DrillDownSheet`
  700×520 → 640×440; `MainWindow` WelcomeOverlay MinWidth 660 → 580.
- Left as-is (degrades gracefully, doesn't hard-clip): Settings storage path
  (TextTrimming + tooltip), PersonDetail name fields (tight but fit), FilePreview
  toolbar (the `*` filename column absorbs the squeeze before buttons clip), sidebar
  (260 px with a Ctrl+Shift+S toggle).

All 6 edited `.xaml` parse as well-formed XML + BOM intact. **Not render-verified**
(no WinUI build/display here) — the user must eyeball on the laptop and report any
remaining clipping (which view + element).

## 2026-05-21 — V16.13 model-load timeout fix + tagging/Deep-Analyze split (first on-hardware run)

The build finally ran on the user's box (NVIDIA **~4 GB VRAM / DirectML**) after they
installed the VS WinUI PRI component (the CLI can't build WinUI here). First scan failed
with a false "models took >30 s / corrupted" — root-caused from the engine log to the
**21.5 s CLIP scene-matrix build** blowing the 30 s `load_default` timeout. Fixed, plus
the user's model-role ask.

- **Scene-label matrix is disk-cached** (`scene_vocab.rs`): build once (~21 s, first
  launch), reload ~instantly after (raw LE f32 + content-hash-keyed header under
  `Models/clip_scene_cache/`; the hit path also skips loading the 253 MB text session).
  **Model-load timeout 30 → 120 s** (`scan.rs`) so the one-time build can't false-fail.
  → first launch slow once, later launches <10 s. Immediate workaround for the user: a
  second "Start Scan" in the same session already worked (matrix cached process-static).
- **Tagging vs Deep Analyze split.** Auto-tag hardwired to **SmolVLM**
  (`EngineClient.AutoTriggerDeepAnalyzeAsync`, gated on SmolVLM weights present); **Deep
  Analyze defaults to Qwen 2.5-VL 3B** (`AppSettings.SelectedVlmModelKind` default → qwen
  + v2→v3 migration off the leaked smolvlm). SmolVLM auto-installs; Qwen installs
  on-demand from the Deep Analyze card.
- **Deep Analyze cards now honest** (V16.12.1): `DeepAnalyzeView.SyncCards` checks each
  model's gguf on disk instead of mirroring the shared "any VLM" slot — Qwen no longer
  falsely shows "Installed".
- **Hardware tailoring confirmed from logs:** DXGI vendor probe (NVIDIA), VRAM probe
  (3935 MB), EP chain cuda→tensorrt→directml→cpu, pool clamped to 1 to fit 4 GB, per-vendor
  runtime auto-install (Vulkan + SmolVLM + CUDA llama runtime + cuDNN all present). Open
  gap: ONNX runs on **DirectML** (the `cuda` ORT pack is `not_yet_available` → ~3-5×
  slower); the VLM path already uses CUDA. Sourcing the ORT CUDA EP DLLs is a follow-up.

### Build/test
- Engine `cargo clippy --all-targets -D warnings` clean (toolchain 1.90, the CI pin).
- C# (`AppSettings`, `EngineClient`, `DeepAnalyzeView`, build-all.ps1 SDK fix) —
  `dotnet format` clean + UTF-8 BOM intact; full WinUI compile is the user's VS build (the
  dotnet CLI here lacks `Microsoft.Build.Packaging.Pri.Tasks.dll`).
- Verify on hardware per NEXT.md V16.13.
